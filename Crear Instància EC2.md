## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
    A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can specify an IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, add gateways, and associate security groups. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC.
